# More Complex TO DO app built with Create-React-App, Redux, and Firebase
Goal of the project is to create a full stack To Do app capable of user authentication and storing and fetching user To Dos from a database.

# Current State - UI and front end functionality under construction
1. default route is the welcome page which displays a demo and option to create accout(currently under construction).
2. todo page with actual app functionality using redux (needs to be hooked up to firebase and user account)
3. profile page - TBD
