# More Complex TO DO app built with Create-React-App
Goal of the project is to create a full stack To Do app capable of user authentication and storing and fetching user To Dos from a database.

# Stage 1 - UI and front end functionality
Goals:
1. to create a clean and interactive design that is engaging and visually appealing to users.
2. to lay out app logic and establish the flow of data in the app - good understanding at high level but details and coding are more difficult.
   1. input form state is beginning to take shape - need to figure out how to pass it to parent and store in array so it can be mapped in the list component
      1. completed!
   2. need to create button functionality on ListItem component so we can check off and remove cards as needed - next challenge!
3. build appealing landing page - complete!
   1. will need to add in user auth and sign in functionality

Challenges:
1. deciding where and how to use state in the app - hooks? class component lifecycle methods?
2. Will state get big enough to justify redux? Don't know yet

# Stage 2 and beyond - backend and user auth
1. will likely be using firebase and provided google auth service
