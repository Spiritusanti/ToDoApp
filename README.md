# More Complex TO DO app built with Create-React-App, Redux, and Firebase
Goal of the project is to create a full stack To Do app capable of user authentication and storing and fetching user To Dos from a database.

# Current State - UI and front end functionality under construction
1. default route is the welcome page which displays a demo and option to create accout.
   1. account creation and sign in will likely be moved to a popup modal to work better with redux.
2. todo page with actual app functionality using redux (needs to be hooked up to firebase and user account)
3. profile page - partially compelete - need to add in firebase auth options for updating info, changin password etc.
